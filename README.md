**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I modified this app to react-redux. I took out the globalstate.js content so I can use react redux. I added various UseSelector and UseDispatch hooks to get
this app running smoothly. There is some load time when the link is clicked, but the app is fully function all the way to checkout.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned a lot about react-redux in this assignment. I learned how to implement react-redux for better operations of a website. Getting this on Heroku was a 
challenge. However, with a lot of persistence and some help from a classmate, I'm able to implement this redux store with mongoDB Atlas.
